<h2>IronPython 1.0 Beta Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q: Is this license OSI compliant?</h4>
<p>A: This license has not been submitted to OSI, but it allows developers to take 
full advantage of a dynamic language on the CLR and to have the freedom to distribute 
their works for the benefit of the community at large. The license is half of a 
page long and very straight forward. We believe it stands up to what developers 
demand of an &quot;open&quot; license.</p>
<h4>Q: What copyright rights does the license grant me?</h4>
<p>A: The license grants you a copyright license to make unlimited copies of the 
Software in source or object code form, as well as to create Derivative Works (as 
that term is defined under US copyright law). This means that in addition to making 
unlimited copies of the Software, you have a copyright license to modify the Software 
and to use all or part of the Software to create a Derivative Work.</p>
<h4>Q: What patent rights does the license grant me?</h4>
A: This license grants you a patent license to use and distribute the Software under 
any Microsoft patent claims that read on the Software itself. In other words, if 
you create a modified version of the Software, you still retain the patent license 
to use and distribute the original portions of the Software under the specific Microsoft 
patent claims that read on the Software, but you do not have a patent license as 
to the new functionality you may have added by modifying the Software. This result 
is typical of many common open source licenses, including the Common Public License 
(CPL) and the Mozilla Public License (MPL). In addition, this license grants no 
rights to any Microsoft patents that read on other components or files not included 
in the Software. This means that no patent license is granted to use or distribute 
any other software or technology that may be needed to use the Software or was created 
from the Software (for example, any compiled output of the Software, the combination 
of the Software with other hardware or other software, or any additional enabling 
technologies that may be necessary to make or use the Software or any final product 
that includes the Software).
<h4>Q: Why do you require .NET 2.0 to run IronPython 1.0 Beta?</h4>
A: There are a lot of features in .NET 2.0 that we wanted to use in IronPython. 
These include generics, DynamicMethods, new kinds of delegates, and more. We could 
have supported these new features using #ifdefs to keep a version of the code base 
that ran on 1.1. We decided that backwards compatibility wasn&rsquo;t worth complicating 
the code base and development of IronPython at this time. We expect that when we 
start working on adding support for new .NET 3.0 features to IronPython that we&rsquo;ll 
do them in the #ifdef or similar way so that IronPython will continue to run on 
.NET 2.0 for the foreseeable future.<br>
<h4>Q: Why does IronPython not follow the standard C# naming conventions, why does 
it have a lot of FxCop errors?</h4>
A: This is IronPython 1.0 Beta. We want to drive this under the principles of &nbsp;&ldquo;release 
early, release often&rdquo;. We will be moving forward quickly with resolving these kinds 
of obvious issues to improve the quality and usability of the code base. However, 
we thought that it was unnecessary to delay the release to take the time to do this 
work first. These kinds of issues will be resolved in the near future as we work 
towards IronPython 1.0.<h4>Q: Why am I getting errors when trying to use WinForms?</h4>
<p>A: One common error that you may be getting is:</p>
<pre>C:\IronPython&gt;ipy.exe
IronPython 1.0 (Beta) on .NET 2.0.50727.42
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import System.Windows.Forms as WinForms
Traceback (most recent call last):
File , line 0, in -toplevel-
AttributeError: 'package#' object has no attribute 'Windows'</pre>
<pre></pre>
<p>The cause is that IronPython needs help finding any assemblies that are even 
a little bit out of the ordinary. Built-in module clr provides functions to add 
references to .NET modules (clr.AddReference). For more information, see the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm#T1.3">Loading .NET Libraries</a> exercise in the
