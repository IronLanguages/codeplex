<h2>IronPython 1.0 Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h4>Q: Is this license OSI compliant?</h4>
<p>A: This license has not been submitted to OSI, but it allows developers to take 
full advantage of a dynamic language on the CLR and to have the freedom to distribute 
their works for the benefit of the community at large. The license is half of a 
page long and very straight forward. We believe it stands up to what developers 
demand of an &quot;open&quot; license.</p>
<h4>Q: What copyright rights does the license grant me?</h4>
<p>A: The license grants you a copyright license to make unlimited copies of the 
Software in source or object code form, as well as to create Derivative Works (as 
that term is defined under US copyright law). This means that in addition to making 
unlimited copies of the Software, you have a copyright license to modify the Software 
and to use all or part of the Software to create a Derivative Work.</p>
<h4>Q: What patent rights does the license grant me?</h4>
A: This license grants you a patent license to use and distribute the Software under 
any Microsoft patent claims that read on the Software itself. In other words, if 
you create a modified version of the Software, you still retain the patent license 
to use and distribute the original portions of the Software under the specific Microsoft 
patent claims that read on the Software, but you do not have a patent license as 
to the new functionality you may have added by modifying the Software. This result 
is typical of many common open source licenses, including the Common Public License 
(CPL) and the Mozilla Public License (MPL). In addition, this license grants no 
rights to any Microsoft patents that read on other components or files not included 
in the Software. This means that no patent license is granted to use or distribute 
any other software or technology that may be needed to use the Software or was created 
from the Software (for example, any compiled output of the Software, the combination 
of the Software with other hardware or other software, or any additional enabling 
technologies that may be necessary to make or use the Software or any final product 
that includes the Software).

<h2>Technical Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Q: How do I report a bug or get help?</h3>
<p>A: On <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ironpython">CodePlex</a> you can file 
bugs by selecting the &quot;Issue Tracker&quot; tab and clicking on &quot;New Work Item&quot;.&nbsp; 
On the home page you'll see a link to join our mailing list.</p>
<h3>Q: Is there Visual Studio integration for completion, coloring, WinForms 
designer, etc.?</h3>
<p>A good explanation of the Visual Studio IronPython integration sample is in
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronmar/archive/2006/02/16/533273.aspx">this 
blog post</a>.</p>
<h3>Q: Why do you require .NET 2.0 to run IronPython 1.0?</h3>
A: There are a lot of features in .NET 2.0 that we wanted to use in IronPython. 
These include generics, DynamicMethods, new kinds of delegates, and more. We could 
have supported these new features using #ifdefs to keep a version of the code base 
that ran on 1.1. We decided that backwards compatibility wasn&rsquo;t worth complicating 
the code base and development of IronPython at this time. We expect that when we 
start working on adding support for new .NET 3.0 features to IronPython that we&rsquo;ll 
do them in the #ifdef or similar way so that IronPython will continue to run on 
.NET 2.0 for the foreseeable future.<br>
<h3>Q: Why does IronPython not follow the standard C# naming conventions, why so 
many FxCop errors?</h3>
A: We have fixed all FxCop errors in the IronPython.Hosting namespace which is 
the main public API exposed by IronPython.&nbsp; However, there are other public 
types that are marked public either because the generated IL code needs them or 
because of historical reasons.&nbsp; While we would like to fix all FxCop issues 
for all public types, those remaining do not affect users of IronPython.&nbsp; 
We want to release IronPython 1.0 under the principles of &nbsp;“release early, 
release often”.&nbsp; We thought that it was unnecessary to delay the release to 
take the time to do this work first.&nbsp; These kinds of issues will be 
resolved as we work on future releases.<h3>Q: Why am I getting errors when trying to use WinForms?</h3>
<p>A: One common error that you may be getting is:</p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>C:\IronPython&gt;ipy.exe
IronPython 1.0.2424 on .NET 2.0.50727.42
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
&gt;&gt;&gt; import System.Windows.Forms as WinForms
Traceback (most recent call last):
File , line 0, in -toplevel-
AttributeError: 'package#' object has no attribute 'Windows'</pre>
</blockquote>
<pre></pre>
<p>The cause is that IronPython needs help finding any assemblies that are even 
a little bit out of the ordinary.&nbsp; The Built-in module clr provides functions to add 
references to .NET modules (clr.AddReference).&nbsp; For more information, see the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm#T1.3">Loading .NET Libraries</a> exercise in the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a>.</p>

<h3>Q: How do I make use of .NET features in IronPython?</h3>
<p>A: Users have to opt in to this functionality.&nbsp; No new keywords have 
been added, and the existing language semantics are unchanged.&nbsp; A “clr” 
module is available for import to turn on .NET extensions. See the
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> for good examples.&nbsp; 
Using the “import clr” statement adds methods to built-in types in some cases; 
for example, dir(int) will show a ToString attribute.&nbsp; Such effects only 
happen in the context of the module that contains the “import clr” statement.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I choose amongst a method's overloads?</h3>
<p>A: .NET methods may have an Overloads attribute which can be indexed by a 
tuple of types to choose between overloads of a .NET method.&nbsp; For example, 
the following chooses the WriteLine method that takes an object and passes None 
for it:</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2">from System import Console<br>
	Console.WriteLine.Overloads[object](None)</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How do I import .NET namespaces from assemblies other than System and 
Mscorlib?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython can directly import only some of the .NET libraries -- the most 
commonly used ones.&nbsp; To use additional .NET assemblies, they must be 
explicitly referenced.&nbsp; To add a reference to a .NET assembly, use one of 
the clr.AddReference* functions.&nbsp; See
<a href="Tutorial/Tutorial.htm">IronPython Tutorial</a> for good examples and 
instruction on how to do this.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I create a .NET array?</h3>
<p>A: Here is an example that shows how to create a .NET array: 
“System.Array[int]((1,2,3))”.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p><font face="Courier New"><font size="2">import System<br>
	System.Array[int]((1,2,3))</font><br>
&nbsp;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: How do I specify generic types, such as collections?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython supports an indexing-like syntax for identifying concrete 
realizations of generic types and methods (for example, “q = 
System.Collections.Generic.Queue[str]()”). This is similar to creating a .NET 
array.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I use CPython standard libraries?</h3>
<p>A: To tell IronPython where the Python standard library is, you can add the 
&quot;lib&quot; directory of CPython to IronPython's path.&nbsp; To do this, put the 
following code into IronPython's &quot;site.py&quot; file (replace c:\python24\lib with 
your actual path to the CPython lib directory): </p>
<blockquote>
	<pre>import sys
sys.path.append(r&quot;c:\python24\lib&quot;)

</pre>
</blockquote>
<h3>Q: Why are some built-in modules not present?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython implements all the commonly used built-in modules.&nbsp; Some 
modules are not implemented because they are OS-specific (for example, they are 
only relevant on SGI or the Mac).&nbsp; Some modules aren't present only because 
we didn't have time to implement them yet.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WorkItem/WorkItemFileAttachmentDownload.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&WorkItemId=2702&FileAttachmentId=642">
IronPython Differences</a> document for details. </p>
<h3>Q: What CPython version are you compatible with?</h3>
<p>A: IronPython 1.0 targeted CPython 2.4.3 for compatibility.&nbsp; See the
<a href="http://www.codeplex.com/WorkItem/WorkItemFileAttachmentDownload.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython&WorkItemId=2702&FileAttachmentId=642">
IronPython Differences</a> document for details.</p>
<h3>Q: Do you have any 2.5 features working?</h3>
<p>A: Yes, IronPython implements several 2.5 features: all(), any(), max() with 
a key argument, min() with a key argument, partition() and rpartition() on 
strings, the with statement, empty parenthetic expression for the bases classes 
in a class statement, try-except-finally, and ternary expressions</p>
<h3>Q: Do we work with the .NET Compact Framework?</h3>
<p>A: No, IronPython 1.0 targets only the .NET 2.0 Common Language Runtime.&nbsp; 
The .NET Compact Framework lacks Reflection.Emit and lightweight code generation 
(dynamic methods), both of which IronPython requires.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I compile .py files to a DLL for linking into my C# or VB program
</h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not support building DLLs for a C# style of linking and 
calling into Python code.&nbsp; You can define interfaces in C#, build those 
into a DLL, and then implement those interfaces in Python code as well as pass the 
python objects that 
implement the interfaces to C# code.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I build and call into PYD libraries </h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not support using PYDs built for CPython since they 
leverage implementation details of CPython.&nbsp; You can get a similar effect 
for new &quot;PYD&quot;s you would like to implement by writing them in C# or VB and 
building a DLL for .NET.</p>
<h3>Q: How do I create, or why don't you create .pyc files</h3>
<p>A: IronPython does not cache binary products for .py files, nor write fast 
loading version of .py files.&nbsp; IronPython will likely support this kind of 
optimization in the future.</p>
